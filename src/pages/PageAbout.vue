        I started coding in the Eighties when i was around 12 years old. I did
        my first steps on a Commodore PET 2001 at school and when i got my own
        Commodore 64, i spent countless hours on that machine, coding day and
        night in BASIC, MACHINE CODE and LOGO. <br />
        <br />
        As i grew older, i decided to take a carreer in my other passion and i
        became a professional musician. So i quit coding, but i always kept
        using computers heavily as a tool to make music. I have worked
        professionally with almost all major Sequencer- and DAW-Applications
        (Cubase, Logic, ProTools, Ableton Live, StudioOne, Samplitude, ...),
        often since the very first Version.
        <br />
        <br />
        I spent the last 20 Years as a Songwriter, Producer, Engineer and
        Musician working on No-1-, Gold- and Platin-Records for German artists
        such as Yvonne Catterfeld, Wincent Weiss, Söhne Mannheims, Leith al
        Deen, Culcha Candela, Helene Fischer as well as for some international
        artist like Paul Anka, Michal Bolten and Berry Manilow. <br />
        <br />
        In 2020 i wanted a change and so i went back to my old passion for
        coding. I started to dive deep into web-technologies, did countless
        tutorials, practised like crazy and graduated from the full-stack web
        development program at Hamburg Coding School in March 2021. <br />
        <br />
        I am still as fascinated by this technology as i was when i was a
        12-year old kid and i still love to learn new stuff every day…
